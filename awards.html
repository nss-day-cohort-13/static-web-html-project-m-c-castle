           <div class="awarDiv">
			<ul><li><h2>Best Buisness In The History of the multiverse Award!</h2></li></ul>
			<p>This prostegious symbol of great achievement has been awarded to virtuFEELZ for being the most advanced, best staffed, coolest, most awesome business in the history of the known universe and all of the known virtual universe! Heres to making the mystery a little less mysterious with the release of every new virtual experience! -"everyone probably"</p>
			<ul><li><h2>The Feelz Award</h2></li></ul>
			I hereby dub virtuFEELZ the most legit way to experience feelz. With virtuFeelz I feel like I can feel feelz again. Some have said that the feels you feel with virtuFEELZ are far too real. When asked "whats the deal?" those who feel the feelz are too real will attempt to steal back the conversation. This is why virtuFEELZ has recieved the FEELZ award, although sometimes the feelz are too real, it still makes us feel mad feelz.   -"everyone definitely"
			<ul><li><h2>Best Adult Human Play Area Award</h2></li></ul>
			The winner for this award was a no brainer. Upon leaving virtuFEELZ workplace I felt like a little peice of my soul was crushed SO HARD by a hydraulic press that it evaported into nothingness. The heartbreak was brought upon by having to leave the most amazing HUMAN CAT PERCH one could ever wish for. I would live in that perch if they would let me. I love the human cat perch so much that I'm in the process of writing a personal letter to the President of the United States in hopes that she will mandate a human cat perch for every workplace. Human Cat Perches are the future and this is why virtuFEELZ DESERVES this award.   -"some guy that visited virtuFEELZ HQ for a 30 minute tour once"

            <ul><li><h2>Other Awards</h2></li></ul>
            FAR TOO MANY TO LIST! THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO OUR DIVINE AWESOMENESS!
