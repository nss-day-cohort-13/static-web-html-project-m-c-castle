				“Back in my day, we only had one type of reality!” Your grandparent might say. Well move over grandpa’s reality, because virtuFEELZ has arrived! Established in 2016 by three NSS students, virtuFEELZ has grabbed the world by its VR mask and isn’t planning on letting go any time soon. Since inception, virtuFEELZ has employed the proprietary methods of a ten question survey and getting you piss-drunk at a bar, to aid in discovering your unadulterated fantasies. While that method hasn’t changed much, the amount and quality of available experiences certainly has! Our developers are hard at work crafting our new line of Augmentations, which are sure to help smooth the sharp edges of your psyche. Let us rewrite your history while you help us write our own.

				At virtuFEELZ it’s not uncommon for our developers to be unsure if they’re in virtual reality, or non-virtual reality (as we like to call it) at any given point. This state of constant confusion bodes well for our developers and their creativity. However, if it becomes too exhausting, they can take a nap on our 3 story human cat perch, or enjoy a prescription written by our staff psychiatrist. To further blur our constructs of reality, we have removed all clocks from our commune. Employees base their day off their own circadian rhythm. Employees are also urged to work using their non-dominant hand, shave their heads, and wear sack-like clothing. If (name) sounds like a good fit for you, check out our job listings!
