			<h1>Mark Easterling</h1>
			<p class="employee-bio">
				Mark’s teachers always told him that his daydreaming would only harm his future. Well, now he’s making a boatload more money than all of them combined. While this may be cogent commentary on educators’ income disparity, we’re going to assume it’s because he’s really good at what he does.

			<h1>Castle Crawford</h1>
			<p class="employee-bio">
				“Castle never much like his schoolin’. I always told the boy if you never study, how you going to ever amount to anything without one of dem educations. Though he never opened a book in my presence, he always showed great promise through his "special projects". One afternoon I made a trip to the WalMart to do my Bi-Annual shoppin’ and like always, I let Castle roam around in the parking lot. The boy begged and begged and eventually came up with enough money to buy the model rocket he had always wanted but his mama would never buy for him. He stayed up all night buildin’ on that rocket and brought it to school the very next day. Without telling anyone he went into the classroom, grabbed the class hamster and sent that poor thing to the moon. When his teacher asked him why Castle why’d you do it? He simply smiled and exclaimed “HAMMY’S AN ASTRONAUT!”. At that very moment I said to myself, that boy’s gone be alright.” - Auntee Dingleburg Jackson

			<h1>Chase Ramsey</h1>
			<p class="employee-bio">
				We're not sure when we hired Chase Ramsey to work with our complex virtual systems. Frankly, we're not even sure that we <i>did</i> hire him...we all arrived to work one morning and found him wrenching away at one of our newer units. He specializes in Franzbergian abstract virtualizations, and he's so adept at it, that we don't even worry about the shadow of a suspicion we all have that he's actually a specter from one of our virtual worlds. In his free time, you can find him listening to music, playing video games, or mumbling silently with his ear to his computer screen.
