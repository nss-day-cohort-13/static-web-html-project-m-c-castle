			<h1>Mark Easterling</h1>

				Mark’s teachers always told him that his daydreaming would only harm his future. Well, now he’s making a boatload more money than all of them combined. While this may be cogent commentary on educators’ income disparity, we’re going to assume it’s because he’s really good at what he does.

			<h1>Chase Ramsey</h1>
			<p class="employee-bio">
				We're not sure when we hired Chase Ramsey to work with our complex virtual systems. Frankly, we're not even sure that we <i>did</i> hire him...we all arrived to work one morning and found him wrenching away at one of our newer units. He specializes in Franzbergian abstract virtualizations, and he's so adept at it, that we don't even worry about the shadow of a suspicion we all have that he's actually a specter from one of our virtual worlds. In his free time, you can find him listening to music, playing video games, or mumbling silently with his ear to his computer screen.
